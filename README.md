**House Price Prediction Project**

This project is centered around forecasting housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques. By employing widely-used Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, it delivers a complete solution for precise price predictions.

**Project Overview:**
The objective is to develop a model capable of predicting housing prices with high accuracy based on various features. This prediction task holds significant value in the real estate and finance sectors, aiding in better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By utilizing machine learning models and a well-prepared dataset, the project provides a robust tool for estimating house prices.

**Key Components:**
- **Data Acquisition and Processing:** The project uses the "California Housing" dataset, readily available through the Scikit-learn library. This dataset includes attributes like house age, room count, population, and median income. Data processing and transformation are carried out with Pandas to prepare it for analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** To extract insights from the dataset, the project employs visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are created to better understand the relationships between features and identify patterns.

- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the regression model's performance. This approach ensures that the model is trained on a portion of the data and then tested on unseen data, allowing for an accurate evaluation of its predictive power.

- **Regression Model with XGBoost:** The XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient boosting framework, is used to build the regression model. Known for handling complex feature interactions and achieving high predictive accuracy, XGBoost is implemented through the Scikit-learn library in this project.

- **Model Evaluation:** The project measures the model's performance using evaluation metrics like R-squared and mean absolute error. R-squared reflects the proportion of variance explained by the model, while mean absolute error indicates the average difference between predicted and actual prices. A scatter plot is also generated to visually compare predicted prices with actual values.

**How to Get Started:**
1. Clone the repository: `gh repo clone MYoussef885/House_Price_Prediction`.
2. Install necessary libraries (skip this step if using Google Colab).
3. Launch Google Colab and open the project file.
4. Run the notebook cells in sequence.

**Conclusion:**
This project presents a well-rounded solution for predicting house prices by integrating data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling with XGBoost. Using the "California Housing" dataset from Scikit-learn, it offers a reliable method for estimating house prices.
